# Quiz_Game
A fun quiz game built in Python.

In this program, I have utilised several principles and features of python programming such as if expressions and asking a user for input and utilising that input in the program. Overall, this program helped me have a better grasp of the logic involved in if statements. Feel free to try it out.
